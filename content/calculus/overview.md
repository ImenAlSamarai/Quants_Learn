# Calculus

Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change, providing the foundation for understanding rates of change (derivatives) and accumulation (integrals). It is essential for quantitative finance, machine learning, and scientific computing.

## Why Calculus Matters in Quant Finance

- **Portfolio Optimization**: Finding optimal asset allocations using gradients and optimization
- **Options Pricing**: Black-Scholes formula relies heavily on calculus and stochastic calculus
- **Risk Management**: Computing Greeks (delta, gamma, vega) for hedging strategies
- **Time Series Analysis**: Modeling continuous-time processes
- **Machine Learning**: Gradient descent and backpropagation are calculus-driven

## Core Concepts

1. **Limits**: The foundation of calculus, describing behavior as values approach specific points
2. **Derivatives**: Measuring instantaneous rates of change
3. **Integrals**: Computing accumulation and areas under curves
4. **Series and Sequences**: Infinite sums and convergence
5. **Multivariable Calculus**: Extensions to multiple dimensions

## Applications in Finance

- Computing portfolio sensitivities (Greeks)
- Solving differential equations in pricing models
- Optimizing trading strategies
- Analyzing continuous-time stochastic processes
- Numerical methods for option pricing
